        <h1>SAMSUNG logo</h1>
        <h3>
          1993 was a pivotal year for Samsung’s logo design. 
          <br>This was the year that the logo we know, and love today was first introduced. 
          <br>This iteration includes updated typography placed within a blue ellipse. 
          <br>Looking at the wordmark, the “A” does not include the horizontal bar, 
          <br>which has helped make this logo unique (and has made the logo iconic as a result) 
          <br>The final logo update for this version is the change in the three stars’ appearance.

        <h1>1938: Samsung is founded</h1>
        <h3>
          The Samsung we know today is not the Samsung that existed when the company was founded. 
          <br>On March 1, 1938, a grocery trading store called, Samsung, was founded by Lee Byung-Chull in Taegu, Korea. 
          <br>This store was focused on trading noodles and other grocery goods that were produced locally, 
          <br>and then Samsung would export these goods to China.
